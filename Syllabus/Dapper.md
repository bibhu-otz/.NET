- Handling non-query SQL commands (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Returning the number of affected rows

### 2.4 Query Mapping
- Mapping query results to C# objects
- Using custom mapping for complex queries
- Handling projections and anonymous types

## 3. Advanced Dapper Concepts

- Executing dynamic SQL queries
- Calling stored procedures with Dapper
- Handling output parameters and return values

### 3.4 Advanced Mapping
- Using custom mapping functions
- Handling complex object graphs and relationships
- Mapping lists and nested objects

## 4. Performance Optimization
### 4.1 Query Optimization

### 4.2 Efficient Data Access Patterns
- Using efficient data access patterns and practices
- Minimizing round-trips to the database
- Batch processing and bulk operations

### 4.3 Caching
- Implementing caching strategies to improve performance
- Using in-memory caching with `IMemoryCache`

## 5. Error Handling and Logging
### 5.1 Error Handling
- Handling exceptions in Dapper operations
- Using try-catch blocks for database operations
- Creating and using custom exception classes

### 5.2 Logging
- Integrating logging into Dapper applications

- Configuring logging levels and outputs

## 6. Security Considerations
### 6.1 SQL Injection Prevention
- Understanding SQL injection risks and attacks
- Using parameterized queries and stored procedures
- Validating and sanitizing input data

### 6.2 Secure Connections
- Implementing encryption for data in transit

- Managing and storing sensitive credentials securely

## 7. Integration with ASP.NET Core
### 7.1 Data Access in ASP.NET Core Applications
- Integrating Dapper with ASP.NET Core
- Configuring data access in `Startup.cs` and `appsettings.json`
- Using dependency injection for Dapper

### 7.2 Building Data Access Layer (DAL)
- Designing and implementing a DAL using Dapper
- Using repository and unit of work patterns for data access
- Managing data contexts and transactions

## 8. Practical Examples and Projects
### 8.1 Sample Applications
- Building a basic CRUD application using Dapper
